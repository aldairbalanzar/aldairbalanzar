# ![aldair_sprite_animation](https://imgur.com/n5kqCKC.gif) About Me
I am Full Stack Web-Developer, Aldair Balanzar, and I am a self-driven problem solver with a knack for creativity. Fabricating optimized solutions and seeing them come to fruition in the hands of a user is the greatest sense of fulfillment.  

When my focus is not programming, I enjoy spending my time indulging in :art:art, :video_game:video games, :soccer:football, :notes:trance music, or time well spent with my :family:family.
