# ![aldair_sprite_animation](https://i.imgur.com/n5kqCKC.gifv) About Me
I am Full Stack Web-Developer, Aldair Balanzar, and I am a self-driven problem solver with a knack for creativity. When my focus is not programming, I enjoy spending my time indulging in art, video games, trance music, or time well spent with my family.
